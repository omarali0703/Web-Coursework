    <p class="subheader">Mitigating Personal Information Exposure on the Web</p>
    <p class="subsubheader">Abstract</p>
    <p>
      Tailoring webpages and applications to our needs is based ostensibly on
      the way we browse and use the web; relevant software is without doubt essential
      to ensure that our experience during this process is both fast and efficient.
      This efficiency is controlled by many components, such as security, type
      of information, validation of information content i.e., reputable and
      accurate; and is especially important in the gathering of personal information.
      Additionally, most website and software frequently used today provide
      extensive security to ensure that the information that is being gathered
      from the end-user is safe and secure on their system; these features are
      built-in, seamless and inconspicuous to the user. However, exposure of
      this information through hacking or other breaching methods e.g.
      physical robbery is still a possibility, and in some cases very likely,
      to happen. This puts the user’s information at high risk of being
      leaked online or sold to criminals that intend on committing
      fraud with your personal details. So how are these exposures mitigated?
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, Camp (1999, p249) suggests that data that is anonymous or not
      linked to a specific individual can be detailed and concise, but should
      not threaten the individual that it refers to, i.e., keeping yourself
      and information about you safe on the web from criminals.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Muftic (2016, p2) tells us that being anonymous on the web
      raises a threat to those less anonymous. Information theft and other
      crimes such as “ransoming” becomes difficult to prevent based on this
      anonymity, as the attacks are often so convoluting i.e., traceability,
      that it becomes difficult to trace back to a specific person or group,
      who are perhaps highly organised, and equally efficient in their
      endeavours. This could mean that if everyone was as anonymous as each
      other, it is likely that information exposure could be a decreasing
      problem, as everyone would perhaps have the same level of knowledge
      about other anonymous users on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal Information may only be retrieved through your actions,
      whether it be voluntary or involuntary. Social networking groups on
      Facebook are mainly built on the retrieval of personal information,
      and are mostly required to be part of that community, i.e., a process
      by which “trust-is- built” between users. This information exposure
      serves to reinforce this trust between users (Po- Ching 2016, p3302),
      including the facilitation and establishment of healthy relationships,
      both social, and professional. However, it allows people within social
      networking groups to access this information – thereby exposing yourself
      to these unknowing dangers with unwanted repercussions that are out of
      your control (Lam 2014, p167).
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though you may be responsible with your information, friends may
      inadvertently reveal information about yourself on their own profile
      (Po-Ching 2016, p3302). In this context, criminals are able to easily
      view your personal information based on the interactions you have with
      friends; this aspect of a web based relationship is out of your control,
      and venerable to a breach in security.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of 2016, Facebook alone has 1.59 billion active users (Dave Chaffey 2016).
      Facebook have introduced extensive security methods to ensure that your personal
      information remains private, as far as it is possible to do so. These include,
      periodic changes in your password i.e., every 90 days, not becoming
      friends with anyone online you do not know, restricting access to your
      personal profile to just your friends and not the public, and not
      providing your entire date of birth. (Dave Chaffey 2016). Social
      engineering attacks are able to be made on banking or other accounts using this

      information. The most common questions that banks ask when verifying
      users are “What is your mother's maiden name?” and “what was your first
      pet's name?”. These small snippets of information could be displayed
      inadvertently, on your profile by perhaps yourself or friends and family.
      (Gallant 2011).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cassim (2015 p79) tells us that the companies that retrieve information
      from users must be registered with an Information Protection Regulator,
      and have an Information Protection Officer to ensure that the data that
      is processed and collected, after consent from the user, complies with
      the relevant data protection act. These regulations, if followed properly
      could prevent the exposure of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that information within large corporations must be kept safe
      in case of information hacks and leaks. In 2014 Yahoo was hacked and 500
      million accounts were compromised that included unwarranted access to
      usernames, emails, hashed passwords and encrypted security questions
      (Kif Leswing 2016). This was potentially due to a state sponsored actor
      who was able to compromise security questions by the simple retrieval
      of maiden and pet names, and memorable dates, etc. (Tim Bradshaw 2016).
      Yahoo have since launched a program to mitigate these exposures and
      breaches. Since this program's inception, 10,000 users have been notified
      that they were targeted. Yahoo have asked users to “consider using a
      simple authentication tool that eliminates the need to use a
      password altogether” (Kif Leswing 2016); this approach would seem to be
      successful, for the moment.
    </p>
    <p class="subsubheader">Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      A recurring theme when discussing information exposure is that the
      information you provide is only as safe as you want it to be. Data
      that is entered anonymously by a user into any online form can never be
      tracked back by criminals, therefore could be rendered useless. It is
      up to the user to make sure that they are cautious about what they
      input, and where they input data on the web. It has become apparent
      that even if the user doesn’t realise they have disclosed any information
      they could well be giving criminals the right information they need to
      breach their personal data and therefore, unknowingly exposed to theft.
