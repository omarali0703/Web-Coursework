    <p class = "subsubheader">Summary</p>
    <p>
      Over the past year in web foundations 1, we have been researching and studying the world wclasse web.
      This entailed a literature review at the start of the year on reducing personal information exposure
      on the web <a href=litreview.html>(see Literature Review)</a>.
      This helped us develop the research skills that we will defiantly need later on In life and throughout this course.
      Secondly we were tasked with the creation of a portfolio website (this on here!). This task tested our knowledge
      of HTML and CSS. With this task, however, came some key lessons that we should take on when creating a website,
      for instance, key designing elements and “un-written” rules that should be taken into account when creating a
      successful website, for example, making sure to separate context from form. This is done using proper HTML and CSS
      etiquette – making sure that all style and formatting is kept well and truly in the style sheet and all the content
      is marked up properly on the HTML side/file.
      Another key element to success web development and other forms of development was efficiency. We were taught proper
      “manners” in term of both keeping your text editor open and full to the brim with add-ons at the same time, for
      instance, ensuring your text size is as small as your corneas can physically handle to allow you to see the most
      code on the screen at one single moment, and secondly to making sure your snippets.cson is packed full of lovely
      short cuts to write as much code as possible with the least amount of key strokes.

    <ul>
      <li> Ensure that passwords are changed frequently </li>
      <li> Prevent information that is personal to you from being inadvertently revealed>
        <ul>
          <li> Through sharing photos </li>
          <li> Unintended information leaks such as mothers maiden name. This could be retrieved but going onto sical media and seaching
                                  through someones page </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Key stroke trackers
        <ul>
          <li> Ensure that, before you turn on any computers, there are no USB flash drives attached to the computer.</li>
          <li>These are able to track and store all the key stroke inputs from the keyboard. This will allow a hacker to
              easily obtain any passwords or personal information about you including bank details, if you are filling
              out any bank forms. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Phishing
        <ul>
          <li>This is the process of tricking someone into inputting personal details into a fake online form. </li>
          <li>These forms are usually disguised as trust worthy pages and can look very similar to other, real, data
              entry forms </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="subsubheader">HTML Introduction</p>

    <p class = "subsubheader">Starting a webserver with WINSCP</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect to your VM using SSH (Secure Shell – e.g. PuTTY or the Chrome plugin).</li>
      <li>Select the “me” folder (where you have already uploaded your web page):
        <ul>
          <li>cd me↵</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Run the Web server
        <ul>
          <li>http-server↵</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Ignore the IP addresses that the web server prints out.
        <ul>
          <li>Note that the server prints out a couple of IP addresses that won't work. You need to use the IP address shown on <a href="http://port.ac.uk/myvm">http://port.ac.uk/myvm</a>!</li>
          <li>If you see the page you made, congratulations, you’ve just built and deployed a web site.</li>
          <li>If you don’t see your page, try and work out where and why it’s failing, and fix it!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class = "subsubheader">Types of Markup</p>
    <p> Procedural Markup - Focuses on how it looks and what to do. (Based of a WYSIWYG basis) </p>
    <p> Descriptive Markup - Focuses on describing the content rather than the formatting and visual aspects. Using proper semantics to describe the content.
        This better allows the developer to seperate the form from the content of the webpage.</p>
    <p class="subsubheader"> Basic HTML tags </p>
    <ul>
      <li> !doctype html - declares that the website is using HTML 5 </li>
      <li> html - declares the start and end of that HTML file</li>
    </ul>
    <p class ="subsubheader"> HTML semantics </p>
    <p> Semantics are used to clearly define the meaning to both the webpage and the developer. they are much better
        than using a div tag as div tags are ambiguous
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> section - proper semantic tag for a section of a webpage </li>
      <li> footer - proper semantic tag for a footer of a webpage </li>
      <li> header - proper semantic tag for a header on a webpage </li>
      <li> aside - proper semantic tag for a section that is next to a section</li>
      <li> article - proper semantic tag for a section containing an article </li>
    </ul>
    <p class = "subsubheader"> Design </p>
    <p>
      Users want to feel accepted and accomplished when they are on and use a webpage. Affective design,
      with the demographics and psychographics of the primary user, considered will ensure
      that this takes place and that the user is most comfortable when using the site. Placement of elements,
      the choice of colour, and the amount of content on the page, all tie together when creating an outstanding
      design.
      Users want to part-take in as little learning as possible when using a webpage as attention span may be
      limited - based on the primary user.
      Web designers must be focused on creating a design that doesn't overload the user with content and information as well as
      adding enough to draw the attention of the user. Not too boring, not too hectic.
      A concept to remember when designing an affective design, is considering how much you can remove from the design
      before it loses purpose. You want the minimal amount on the page to do its job - Further increasing load times of the
      site as well as not crowding the page with unnecessary images and content.

      "Design isn't just how it looks, it's how it works." - Steve Jobs.
    </p>
    <p class = "subsubheader"> Usability </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that comes to mind when considering usability is the primary users mental model. What are your primary
      users used to? Are they behind a desk using word all day? Are they playing video games until 3 in the morning?
      When these specific users are interacting with your page, they will have certain expectations, where buttons should be
      placed, what icons mean etc.. These aspects should be considered when designing the webpage layout and
      style. Perhaps your user is a big mobile user, when they access a webpage where are their eyes going to go first? Where
      will they go to navigate pages? How much information are they used to seeing before losing interest.
      Beta testing a page can be an effective way to flag up any elements that may be causing issues or elements that are being
      used constantly. The use of website cookies will allow the developer/company/organisation see exactly where the users are going
      when they use the page. These can then be addressed to ensure that the user can find/locate them much easier in the next iteration
      of the page.
