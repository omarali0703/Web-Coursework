    <p class = "subsubheader">Summary</p>
    <p>
      Over the past year in web foundations 1, we have been researching and studying the world wclasse web.
      This entailed a literature review at the start of the year on reducing personal information exposure
      on the web <a href=litreview.html>(see Literature Review)</a>.
      This helped us develop the research skills that we will defiantly need later on In life and throughout this course.
      Secondly we were tasked with the creation of a portfolio website (this on here!). This task tested our knowledge
      of HTML and CSS. With this task, however, came some key lessons that we should take on when creating a website,
      for instance, key designing elements and “un-written” rules that should be taken into account when creating a
      successful website, for example, making sure to separate context from form. This is done using proper HTML and CSS
      etiquette – making sure that all style and formatting is kept well and truly in the style sheet and all the content
      is marked up properly on the HTML side/file.
      Another key element to success web development and other forms of development was efficiency. We were taught proper
      “manners” in term of both keeping your text editor open and full to the brim with add-ons at the same time, for
      instance, ensuring your text size is as small as your corneas can physically handle to allow you to see the most
      code on the screen at one single moment, and secondly to making sure your snippets.cson is packed full of lovely
      short cuts to write as much code as possible with the least amount of key strokes.

    <p class="subsubheader">HTML Introduction</p>

    <p class = "subsubheader">Starting a webserver with WINSCP</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect to your VM using SSH (Secure Shell – e.g. PuTTY or the Chrome plugin).</li>
      <li>Select the “me” folder (where you have already uploaded your web page):
        <ul>
          <li>cd me↵</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Run the Web server
        <ul>
          <li>http-server↵</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Ignore the IP addresses that the web server prints out.
        <ul>
          <li>Note that the server prints out a couple of IP addresses that won't work. You need to use the IP address shown on <a href="http://port.ac.uk/myvm">http://port.ac.uk/myvm</a>!</li>
          <li>If you see the page you made, congratulations, you’ve just built and deployed a web site.</li>
          <li>If you don’t see your page, try and work out where and why it’s failing, and fix it!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class = "subsubheader">Types of Markup</p>
    <p> Procedural Markup - Focuses on how it looks and what to do. (Based of a WYSIWYG basis) </p>
    <p> Descriptive Markup - Focuses on describing the content rather than the formatting and visual aspects. Using proper semantics to describe the content.
        This better allows the developer to seperate the form from the content of the webpage.</p>
    <p class="subsubheader"> Basic HTML tags </p>
    <ul>
      <li> !doctype html - declares that the website is using HTML 5 </li>
      <li> html - declares the start and end of that HTML file</li>
    </ul>
    <p class ="subsubheader"> HTML semantics </p>
    <p> Semantics are used to clearly define the meaning to both the webpage and the developer. they are much better
        than using a div tag as div tags are ambiguous
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> section - proper semantic tag for a section of a webpage </li>
      <li> footer - proper semantic tag for a footer of a webpage </li>
      <li> header - proper semantic tag for a header on a webpage </li>
      <li> aside - proper semantic tag for a section that is next to a section</li>
      <li> article - proper semantic tag for a section containing an article </li>
    </ul>
    <p class = "subsubheader"> CSS </p>
    <p>
      CSS is a dynamic way to format a webpage. It allows the user to describe the format and design of the page. This
      works through a combination of editing existing HTML tags (body, li, ul etc.) and creating classes and ids. These allow you to
      specificly design/edit different aspects of the webpage. Classes are designed to let you assign the same style to multiple elements
      on the page, whereas id's let you specifically change one element. These can be combined to create very elegent and specifc designs
      and formats on the webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      inline CSS involves placing the CSS inside the HTML file. This is particularly useful for testing specific elements on the webpage before
      making any design choice final. However, it is the correct practice to separate the form/design from the content of the webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      external CSS involves relocating the style sheet code into an external file and then linking to it in the head of the HTML page.
      This is much better practice as it allows the page to only have to load the CSS file once and save it in cache. this makes page loading times
      much faster as the style code doesn't have to be read everytime another page is loaded, this in turn reduces the file size of the HTML files
      further increasing the load times of the webpage.
    </p>
    <p class = "subsubheader"> Advanced CSS </p>
    <p class = "subsubheader"> Design </p>
    <p>
      Users want to feel accepted and accomplished when they are on and use a webpage. Affective design,
      with the demographics and psychographics of the primary user, considered will ensure
      that this takes place and that the user is most comfortable when using the site. Placement of elements,
      the choice of colour, and the amount of content on the page, all tie together when creating an outstanding
      design.
      Users want to part-take in as little learning as possible when using a webpage as attention span may be
      limited - based on the primary user.
      Web designers must be focused on creating a design that doesn't overload the user with content and information as well as
      adding enough to draw the attention of the user. Not too boring, not too hectic.
      A concept to remember when designing an affective design, is considering how much you can remove from the design
      before it loses purpose. You want the minimal amount on the page to do its job - Further increasing load times of the
      site as well as not crowding the page with unnecessary images and content.

      "Design isn't just how it looks, it's how it works." - Steve Jobs.
    </p>
    <p class = "subsubheader"> Usability </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that comes to mind when considering usability is the primary users mental model. What are your primary
      users used to? Are they behind a desk using word all day? Are they playing video games until 3 in the morning?
      When these specific users are interacting with your page, they will have certain expectations, where buttons should be
      placed, what icons mean etc.. These aspects should be considered when designing the webpage layout and
      style. Perhaps your user is a big mobile user, when they access a webpage where are their eyes going to go first? Where
      will they go to navigate pages? How much information are they used to seeing before losing interest.
      Beta testing a page can be an effective way to flag up any elements that may be causing issues or elements that are being
      used constantly. The use of website cookies will allow the developer/company/organisation see exactly where the users are going
      when they use the page. These can then be addressed to ensure that the user can find/locate them much easier in the next iteration
      of the page. 

    <p class = "subsubheader"> Accessability </p>
    <p>
      It is important that anyone using any webpage can access and use any part of the website to its full potential.
     Therefore it obvious that any form of disability/language barrier is taken into account when dealing with how accessible your webpage is.
     Techniques to allow anyone to view your webpage can include clear HTML semantics and/or alt tags to allow any text-to-speak to clearly read all the
     text on the screen. any videos that are present on the page should be close-captioned to allow anyone who is deaf to understand
     clearly what is going on in the video.
     Colour schemes are also an important aspect to consider. Firstly, it has been
     proven that particular colour schemes (navy-blue text on a cream background) can improve the reading of people with dyslexia.
     Another aspect of colour schemes is colour-blindness. Using specific shades of colour next to one another, can cause it to not be visible all together.
     Text should always be placed atop a background colour that contrasts the font colour. This will ensure that the user, should they be colour blind,
     has the best chance at reading the content on the page.

    <p class = "subsubheader"> Graphics </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        GIF
        <ul>
          <li>
            This is a low resolution image format that supports animation. They support a 8 bit colour range meaning that in order
            for the image to support particular colours they must use a technique called ditering. This involves taking two pixels or different colours and
            placing them next to each other. When the image is then viewed at 100% or less, the images colours appear to blend together creating the desired shade
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        SVG
        <ul>
          <li>
            This is less of an image and more of a "text" file. Based of xml and html semantic, SVGs are files that tell the webpage how to draw particular graphics.
            This means that they are essentially being generated. They are not a bitmap and therefore their "resolution" isn't deminished when resized.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        PNG
        <ul>
          <li>
            These are bitmaped images that support up to 24 bits of colour (8 bits per channel) for RGB and 32 bits of colour for RGBA (transparency). They also
            support lossless image compression meaning that they do not lose any detail/resolution when compressed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        JPEG
        <ul>
          <li>
            JPEGs are know as a lossy image format. This means that they lose a small amount of detail when they compressed. They support full colour (24 bits). However,
            as said before, they do not compress well with large areas of similar colour and very rarely can they deal with sharp lines, often bluring them completly when
            compressing them.
