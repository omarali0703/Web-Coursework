    <p class = "subsubheader">Summary</p>
    <p>
      Over the past year in web foundations 1, we have been researching and studying the world wclasse web.
      This entailed a literature review at the start of the year on reducing personal information exposure
      on the web <a href=litreview.html>(see Literature Review)</a>.
      This helped us develop the research skills that we will defiantly need later on In life and throughout this course.
      Secondly we were tasked with the creation of a portfolio website (this on here!). This task tested our knowledge
      of HTML and CSS. With this task, however, came some key lessons that we should take on when creating a website,
      for instance, key designing elements and “un-written” rules that should be taken into account when creating a
      successful website, for example, making sure to separate context from form. This is done using proper HTML and CSS
      etiquette – making sure that all style and formatting is kept well and truly in the style sheet and all the content
      is marked up properly on the HTML side/file.
      Another key element to success web development and other forms of development was efficiency. We were taught proper
      “manners” in term of both keeping your text editor open and full to the brim with add-ons at the same time, for
      instance, ensuring your text size is as small as your corneas can physically handle to allow you to see the most
      code on the screen at one single moment, and secondly to making sure your snippets.cson is packed full of lovely
      short cuts to write as much code as possible with the least amount of key strokes.
